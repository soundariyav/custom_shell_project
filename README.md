# custom_shell_project
I am working on custom shell project. As of now i have include the basic prompt asking for your input. Once user gives inputs it creates a child process using fork and excevp makes the user to run their program. Currently my shell gives the status of its execution and i have used stderr to provide the error messages. Working on this project to enhance my custom shell.
